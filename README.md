# Webpack Config Project with Microfrontend Architecture

This project utilizes Microfrontend architecture to allow independently deliverable frontend applications to be composed into a greater whole. Webpack 5's Module Federation feature facilitates this by enabling code to be shared and loaded at runtime.

## Introduction

Microfrontends is an architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole. Module Federation is a feature in Webpack 5 that makes the implementation of microfrontends easier by allowing code to be shared and loaded at runtime.

## About Webpack

Webpack is a powerful and flexible module bundler primarily used for JavaScript applications. It takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules. Key features include:

- **Code Splitting**: Webpack allows you to split your code into various bundles which can then be loaded on demand or in parallel.
- **Loaders**: Transform your files into modules as they are processed by Webpack. Loaders can preprocess files as needed (e.g., transpiling JavaScript, converting SASS to CSS).
- **Plugins**: Extend Webpack's capabilities with plugins that perform a wide range of tasks, such as bundle optimization, asset management, and injection of environment variables.
- **Dev Server**: Provides a development server that serves your project locally with live reloading.
